# Cluster Communication System

This project implements a **distributed cluster network** using **UDP-based messaging**.
It enables **intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication** between worker nodes (node.py) and master nodes (master.py).

## Features
- **Master & Worker Nodes**: Masters manage message routing between clusters.
- **UDP Messaging**: Supports Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast.
- **Logging System**: Tracks all communication in a CSV log.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easily run the entire system using Docker.

- **Remove Old Logs**: `rm ./logs/network_log.csv` Ensures that the log file is cleared before starting the system.
- **Stop Containers**: `docker-compose down` ensures that no containers are running before starting fresh.
- **Clean Docker System**: `docker system prune -af` cleans up unused resources to avoid conflicts.
- **Start Containers**: `docker-compose up --build` brings up the containers as defined.
- **View Logs**: `docker-compose logs` displays the logs to monitor the system's behavior.
